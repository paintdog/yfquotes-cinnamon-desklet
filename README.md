## Description
This repository contains a [desklet for the Cinnamon desktop environment](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/desklets) that displays financial market information provided by [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).

This desklet is based on the [desklet from fthuin](https://github.com/fthuin/yahoofinance-cinnamon-desklet). The data retrieval part is adopted to an alternative service url, after the Yahoo Finance community table got retired in May 2017.

Tested with
- Linux Mint Cinnamon 17 up to 20
- Debian 9 with Cinnamon 3.2
- Manjaro with Cinnamon 3.8

## Installation
Either follow the installation instructions on [Cinnamon spices](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/desklets), or manually download the folder **yfquotes@thegli** (below "files") and copy the folder and its content to *~/.local/share/cinnamon/desklets/*.

## Configuration
Check out the desklet configuration settings, and choose the data refresh period, the list of quotes to show (see also [Known Limitations](#known-limitations)), and quote details to display. The default list contains the Dow 30 companies.

- The quotes list might not be editable using the desklet's configuration dialog (encountered in Cinnamon 3.6 and earlier 3.x versions). As a workaround, export the configuration using the standard desklet settings menu to a (json) file, then edit the file with your favorite text editor, and finally import the configuration file again.
